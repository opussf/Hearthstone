# Possible next steps:

[ ] Have time sensitive list
	Make a list of toys for any modifier that exists until a time stamp.  Takes priority.
	To Allow one to focus on a holiday, that auto expires.  Instead of using a different modifier.

[ ] Configure when the macro updates
	Right now it is auto tied to the PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event, or manually with `/hs update`.
	Allow it to be tied to other events, or even remove the connection to the current event.

[ ] Make some selections char specific.

[ ] Allow it to support multiple macros, with different mod lists for each.
	HS macro
	Toy macro
	etc macro
